This is a simple numerical simulation of bayesian decision making algorithm based on the research article 'Bayes Bots: Collective Bayesian Decision-Making in Decentralized
Robot Swarms'. Some parts of the algorithm discussed on the paper have been tweaked to fit numerical simulation. The code outputs a text file with every possible combination
of inputs and draws a plot for each fill ratio (percentage of white tiles on the field).
